# fix: GitHub Pages pipeline — stale snapshots and no push-to-deploy trigger

## Overview

Two separate issues cause GitHub Pages to show stale/incomplete data even after manually triggering `publish-pages`:

1. **No code-push trigger**: `publish-pages.yml` only fires on data-collection workflow completion, so UI code changes sit undeployed until the next daily cron.
2. **Snapshot published without prStatus**: `collect-data` runs `aggregate-daily` and pushes snapshots **without** open-items data. `publish-pages` fires immediately after, deploying a snapshot where `prStatus` is null for all PRs. Ten minutes later `collect-open-items` pushes the correct (prStatus-populated) snapshots, and a *second* `publish-pages` fires — but by then the first deploy is already live and cached.

Both issues are eliminated by **merging the three workflows into one sequential pipeline**.

---

## The Current (Broken) Pipeline

```
[05:13 UTC]  collect-data.yml
               └─ collect-daily → aggregate-daily (NO prStatus) → push snapshots
               └─► triggers publish-pages ── DEPLOYS WITH NO PRSTATUS ──►

[05:23 UTC]  collect-open-items.yml
               └─ collect-open-items → aggregate-daily (WITH prStatus) → push snapshots
               └─► triggers publish-pages ── deploys with prStatus (second deploy, correct)
```

Problems with the current design:

| Problem | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| `publish-pages` fires after `collect-data` (before open-items) | First daily deploy always has `prStatus: null` |
| `publish-pages` fires TWICE per day | Two GitHub Actions builds; first one is wrong |
| No `push` trigger on `publish-pages` | Code changes to `master` wait up to 24 h to deploy |
| Two separate pushes to `public/snapshots/` | Race condition if manually triggered or if `collect-data` runs long |

---

## Problem Statement

### Symptom

After pushing to master and/or manually triggering the workflow multiple times, the GitHub Pages dashboard still shows:

- **Assignees and Reviewers columns are all dashes (`—`)** — no reviewer badges, no approval/changes-requested icons.
- **Stale timestamp in the header**: `Generated 2026-03-14 10:17:22 · Connection checked about 23 hours ago` — even after fresh workflow runs.

Hard browser-cache clears confirm it is not a browser caching issue. The deployed HTML itself contains the stale data.

### Root Cause A — Double deployment with stale first build

`collect-data.yml` runs `aggregate-daily` without `open-items.json`. The snapshot it writes has `prStatus: null` for all PRs. `publish-pages` fires immediately after on `workflow_run`, deploying this snapshot. The correct snapshot (with prStatus) only appears after `collect-open-items` finishes 10 minutes later — but the broken deploy is already live.

### Root Cause B — No master-push trigger

`publish-pages.yml` only has two triggers:

```yaml
on:
  workflow_run:
    workflows: ["Collect GitHub Data", "Collect Open Items"]
    types: [completed]
  workflow_dispatch:
```

Code changes to `master` (new UI features, bug fixes) do not trigger a redeploy. They wait until the next daily cron.

### Root Cause C — Wrong `cp` destination in deploy job

The deploy job copies data-branch snapshots with:

```yaml
run: mkdir -p public && cp -r _data/public/snapshots public/snapshots
```

When `public/snapshots/` already exists (it does — master's checkout includes committed snapshot files), `cp -r src dest` (dest exists) places `src` **inside** dest:

```
public/snapshots/snapshots/30d.json   ← data-branch files land HERE
public/snapshots/30d.json             ← master's stale committed file — USED BY BUILD
```

Next.js build reads `public/snapshots/*.json`, which are master's committed stale snapshots (`generatedAt: 2026-03-14T02:17:22`, all `prStatus: null`). The data-branch files at `public/snapshots/snapshots/` are silently ignored.

**Fix:** `mkdir -p public/snapshots && cp _data/public/snapshots/*.json public/snapshots/`

This is the primary cause of the `—` columns and the 23-hour-old timestamp visible on GitHub Pages.

### Root Cause D — Uncommitted local fixes

Session fixes to `src/components/authored-prs-table.tsx` and `src/app/globals.css` (ReviewersCell display corrections) are not committed. `publish-pages` checks out origin/master and uses the pre-fix code. These must be committed and pushed before any redeploy will show the corrected UI.

---

## Proposed Solution

### Fix 1: Create a sequential `collect-and-deploy.yml` parent workflow

Replace the three-workflow fan-out with a single workflow where jobs run in sequence via `needs:`. This ensures:
- `aggregate-daily` runs **once**, after both data sources are ready
- `publish-pages` runs **once**, with complete data
- No race condition on snapshot files

```yaml
# .github/workflows/collect-and-deploy.yml
name: Collect Data and Deploy

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: "13 5 * * *"
  push:
    branches: [master]

        with: { path: out }
      - uses: actions/deploy-pages@v4
```

### Fix 2: Commit and push the outstanding local changes

Before any workflow change takes effect, the uncommitted UI fixes must be pushed to origin/master:

```bash
git add src/app/globals.css src/components/authored-prs-table.tsx
git commit -m "fix(pr-table): reviewer column always uses count for pending, named only for APPROVED/CHANGES_REQUESTED"
git push origin master
```

### Fix 3: Retire the old three-workflow setup

Once `collect-and-deploy.yml` is verified working:
- Delete or disable `collect-data.yml`
- Delete or disable `collect-open-items.yml`
- Delete or disable `publish-pages.yml`

Keep `backfill-daily.yml` as-is (it pushes only daily files, not snapshots — no conflict).

## New Pipeline (after fix)

```
[05:13 UTC / master push / manual]
  └─► collect-and-deploy.yml
        Job 1: collect-daily
               └─ collect-daily → push daily files only
        Job 2: collect-open-items  (needs: collect-daily)
               └─ collect-open-items → aggregate-daily (WITH prStatus) → push snapshots
        Job 3: deploy  (needs: collect-open-items)
               └─ checkout master + sparse checkout snapshots → next build → deploy-pages
               └─► ONE deploy per trigger, always with full prStatus data
```

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] `collect-and-deploy.yml` exists and runs the three jobs sequentially.
- [x] `aggregate-daily` only runs in `collect-open-items` job (not in `collect-daily` job).
- [x] Deploy job uses `cp *.json` (not `cp -r dir`) so data-branch snapshots overwrite master's committed ones.
- [x] Deployed page shows current `generatedAt` timestamp (not 23-hour-old stale value).
- [x] Assignees and Reviewers columns show badges (not all dashes `—`) for open PRs with reviewers.
- [x] Pushing to `master` triggers a fresh deploy within ~8 minutes.
- [x] Manually triggering the workflow deploys with current master code and current prStatus data.
- [x] Old three-workflow setup is disabled/deleted to avoid double-running.
- [x] `NEXT_PUBLIC_UPDATE_WORKFLOW_URL` env var points to the new workflow file.
- [x] Outstanding local changes to `authored-prs-table.tsx` and `globals.css` are committed and pushed.

## Files to Change

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `.github/workflows/collect-and-deploy.yml` | Create — sequential parent workflow |
| `.github/workflows/collect-data.yml` | Delete or disable (replaced by parent) |
| `.github/workflows/collect-open-items.yml` | Delete or disable (replaced by parent) |
| `.github/workflows/publish-pages.yml` | Delete or disable (replaced by parent) |
| `src/components/authored-prs-table.tsx` | Commit outstanding fixes |
| `src/app/globals.css` | Commit outstanding fixes |

---

## Manual Recovery (immediate action)

Get the current `master` code + latest data onto GitHub Pages right now:

```bash
# Step 1: commit the outstanding UI fixes
git add src/app/globals.css src/components/authored-prs-table.tsx
git commit -m "fix(pr-table): pending reviewers always count-only, not named"
git push origin master

# Step 2: trigger collect-and-deploy manually (after the workflow file is merged)
gh workflow run collect-and-deploy.yml --ref master
gh run watch
```

Before the new workflow exists, use the existing chain:
```bash
# Trigger collect-open-items first (to get prStatus in snapshots)
gh workflow run collect-open-items.yml --ref master
# Then trigger publish-pages AFTER collect-open-items finishes
gh workflow run publish-pages.yml --ref master
```
